1.  "stdint.h" is a header file that declares sets of intger types having specified widths.
2.  The point is that I want a specific width (or bits) for each intger,
    like uint32_t is a 32 bits unsigned intger type and cannot be negative.
3.  BYTE = 8 bits = 1 byte
    DWORD = 32 bits = 4 bytes "unsigned"
    LONG = 32 bits = 4 bytes  "signed"
    WORD = 16 bits = 2 bytes
4.  the first two bytes of any BMP file must be BM in ASCII or 0x42 0x4D in hexadecimal
5.  bfSize is the size of the bitmap file in bytes, biSize is the number of bytes that the structure requires.
6.  It means that the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is upper-left corner.
7.  biBitCount
8.  because some problems may happen like running out of memory or something like that but it's rare. (so files cannot be opened).
9.  because it indicates to the number of elements we want to read, and we read struct so we don't need to read more than one.
10. padding = (4 - (3 * 3) % 4) % 4
            = 3
            the value is 3
11. It allows us to rewind or fast-forward within the file.
12. It's a whence argument for fseek() and if it is put to whence, the offset is relative to the current position indicator.
